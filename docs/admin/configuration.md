# Configuring {{ product_name }} RoomServer

The {{ product_name }} RoomServer can be configured using environment variables and a configuration file.
Environment variables take precedence over the configuration file.

## Environment variables

Settings in the configuration file can be overwritten by environment variables,
nested fields are separated by two underscores `__`. The pattern looks like
this:

```sh
OT_ROOMSERVER_<field>__<nested-field>…
```

### Arrays

Some configuration options allow to configure multiple values.

- `OT_ROOMSERVER_METRICS__ALLOWLIST` expects a coma separated list
    - `172.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16`
- `OT_ROOMSERVER_HTTP__API_KEYS` expects a coma separated list where key and secret are separated by a colon `:`
    - `roomserver:secret1,recorder:secret2`

## Sections in the configuration file

- [Http](http_server.md)
- [Controller](controller.md)
- [Monitoring](observability/monitoring.md)
- [Metrics](observability/metrics.md)
- [Tracing](observability/tracing.md)
- [Conference](conference.md)
- [Defaults](defaults.md)
- [Reports](reports.md)

## Example configuration file

This file can be found in the source code distribution under `example/roomserver.toml`
