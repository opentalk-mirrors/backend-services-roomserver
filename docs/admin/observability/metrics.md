# Metrics

The {{ product_name }} RoomServer is collecting metrics and can expose them through the `/metrics` endpoint. The metrics can be accessed via the `/metrics` endpoint in the [OpenMetrics Text Format](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics), which is utilized by [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#openmetrics-text-format).

## Configuration

The section in the [configuration file](../configuration.md) is called `metrics`.

By default the `/metrics` endpoint is disabled. It can be enabled, by adding the `[metrics]` section to the configuration file. By default, the `/metrics` endpoint refuses all connections. The access can be configured with an allowlist.
